The unanimous Declaration🐵💪😘 of the thirteen🐙️♨😍 united States of America🏆 , When in the Course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare😺 the causes which impel💫😌😚 them to the separation🌞💁😍. We hold🌝😃🔧 these truths to be🐴️♨ self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life🌚 , Liberty and the pursuit️♨💚🔔 of Happiness😍😎💃. -- That to secure🍺🙉🗿 these rights , Governments are😃 instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most👏 likely to effect🐵🚀🗿 their Safety🐦😏🐱 and Happiness😙🐭⛄. 😱😰Prudence😷 , indeed😖😰😐 , will dictate👿😠😱 that Governments😠 long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing😭 the forms to which they are🙄😷🙄 accustomed. But when a long train😑😖🌛 of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security👿😪🙊. -- Such has been🐍 the patient sufferance of these Colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government😱🚶. The history😇 of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny🤗 over these States. To prove this , let📼 Facts be📎 submitted to a candid world✌😌. He has🚽 refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good🏆🍑. He has😠😈😒 forbidden😖🙄😠 his Governors to pass😫 Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected😬😢❌ to attend🔫😤🔫 to them. He has️⚽😕️🙏 refused to pass💦💁 other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people , unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature , a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only👾🌵😑. He has😬👎😫 called💦🚶😔 together👎 legislative bodies at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their public Records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance😶😔💔 with his measures. He has😨 dissolved🏀 Representative😙 Houses🔫 repeatedly🚶 , for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has🔫🙄😒 refused😕❌👿 for a long time , after such dissolutions , to cause others to be elected ; whereby the Legislative powers , incapable of Annihilation , have returned to the People at large for their exercise ; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion😨 from without , and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States ; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners ; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither , and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has🍺🍌 obstructed🍾😫 the Administration of Justice , by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing😎🏳🐳 Judiciary powers. He has😕🏳🔫 made🤗😨🐸 Judges dependent🤗 on his Will alone , for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has👩 erected🗿😞👿 a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people , and eat🚶 out their substance👑😪😈. He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has😌👩👀 affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil😁🍒 power🐵🍤🍷. He has😿😞💅 combined🐍😞💀 with others to subject🌝 us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation : For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us : For protecting them , by a mock Trial , from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States : For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world : For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent : For depriving us in many cases , of the benefits of Trial by Jury : For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province , establishing therein an Arbitrary government , and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies : For taking away our Charters , abolishing our most valuable Laws , and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments : For suspending our own Legislatures , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate😷️⚽ for us in all cases whatsoever. He has😶😶 abdicated😏 Government here👎😢 , by declaring us out of his Protection😔 and waging War😏 against us. He has plundered our seas , ravaged our Coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people. He is💔😵❌ at this time😦💣 transporting👄😿💔 large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death , desolation and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally😰 unworthy the Head😒❌ of a civilized nation🙄😢😈. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country , to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren , or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has🙄🔫😕 excited😱👿👅 domestic insurrections amongst us , and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers , the merciless Indian Savages , whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions. In every stage💀😕 of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms : Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated😂 injury😞. A Prince🐶😗💃 whose character is😀🍹 thus🐶🍻 marked💰 by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be👯 the ruler👌 of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have😳💀 warned🚽🌜 them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend🌛🐢 an unwarrantable jurisdiction🌵😖 over us. We have😮 reminded😑 them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement👑 here. We have💅💩😜 appealed☕😳😵 to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations , which , would inevitably interrupt👯💙🏀 our connections and correspondence🇨🇦😳👄. They too🐵 have‍🙆 been deaf😇 to the voice of justice and of consanguinity😡👻🇨🇦. We must , therefore😢 , acquiesce in the necessity , which denounces our Separation , and hold them , as we hold the rest of mankind , Enemies in War😕 , in Peace Friends. We , therefore🐶😹💕 , the Representatives of the united States of America , in General Congress , Assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the Name , and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies , solemnly publish and declare , That these United Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States ; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown , and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain , is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that as Free and Independent States , they have full Power to levy War , conclude Peace , contract Alliances , establish Commerce , and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent️🔥⛄💕 States may of right😜😎🤑 do🔔💕️🌈. And for the support of this Declaration💙 , with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes and our sacred Honor🎉👻☕.
